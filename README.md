# Oracle of Thabes

The Oracle of Thabes is a browser extension that uses local AI models to summarize the contents and answer questions about your open tabs.

- Every tab is automatically summarized so you can quickly find the exact one you need.
- You can "Chat with your tabs" too, to get answers across multiple open tabs.
- All work is done locally and never leaving your computer.
- Batteries included: The system is using built-in Gemini Nano models distributed with Chrome. No setup, no API keys, no terminal.

Here is a demo video:
